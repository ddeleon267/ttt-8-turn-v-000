# #DISPLAY_BOARD
# Should accept a board as an argument and print out the current state of the board for the user.

#VALID_MOVE?
# Should accept a board and an index from the user and return true if the index is within the correct range of 0-8 and is currently unoccupied by an X or O token.

# ask for input


# get input



# convert input to index

#MOVE
# This method should accept a board, an index from the user (which was converted from their raw input with input_to_index), and a token to mark that position with (you can give that argument a default value of 'X'––we're not worrying about whose turn it is yet). The method should set the correct index value of that position within the board equal to the token.

# if index is valid
#   make the move for index
#   show the board
# else
#   ask for input again until you get a valid input
# end
